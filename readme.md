# Data Structures Learning Project

This project was created as a personal study initiative to improve my understanding of **data structures** and their practical implementation in programming.  
The goal is to strengthen core computer science skills by building and experimenting with common data structures from scratch.

## 🚀 Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:
- To **practice** implementing classic data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- To **understand** how these structures work internally and how they manage memory and operations.
- To **improve** algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
- To **gain confidence** in using data structures in real-world projects and technical interviews.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs and Traversal Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** Java
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📚 Learning Approach

Each data structure is implemented manually and accompanied by:
- Clear code examples
- Basic operations (insert, delete, search, traverse)
- Simple test cases or demonstrations

## 💡 Future Plans

- Add time complexity analysis for each structure
- Implement more advanced structures (Heaps, Tries, AVL Trees)
- Include small projects that apply these data structures
